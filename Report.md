## 1) Project Objectives, Product Concept, Market Opportunity, Target Customers

### Objectives
1. Launch a consumer-grade energy optimization platform that delivers **15–25% annual bill reduction** for solar + battery households within 12 months of launch.
2. Achieve **>30% attach rate** among new EverBright solar customers and **>15% conversion** of existing customers in Year 1.
3. Create a scalable data platform to support future services (virtual power plant participation and dynamic pricing).

### Product Concept
**EverBright GridSense** is a mobile + web application that connects to existing EverBright solar and battery systems, smart thermostats, EV chargers, and major appliances. The platform forecasts household energy use, utility price shifts, and weather to recommend and automate optimal energy schedules. It provides:
- **AI-optimized energy schedules** (charge/discharge, load shifting).
- **Savings transparency** with real-time bill impact and carbon reduction.
- **Utility program integration** (time-of-use, demand response, VPP).

### Market Opportunity
- **Macro Trend:** Residential energy costs rose ~15%+ in the past 2 years in many U.S. regions; time-of-use and variable rate plans are expanding.
- **TAM:** ~4.5M U.S. households with solar + storage by 2027 (SEIA growth projections, industry estimates).  
- **SAM:** 1.2M current EverBright addressable customers over 3 years (existing + new solar customers).  
- **SOM:** 200K active users in 24 months (based on adoption and rollout capacity).

### Target Customer Segments
1. **Solar + battery homeowners (primary):** seeking bill reduction and system ROI transparency.
2. **EV owners with home charging:** price-sensitive and open to automation.
3. **Eco-conscious homeowners:** prioritize sustainability and smart home tech.

**Key Jobs-to-be-Done:** “Help me reduce my electricity bill and manage my solar system without manual effort or technical expertise.”

## 2) Strategy Development: Product Development, Testing, Positioning, Pricing & Go-to-Market

### Product Development Plan (MVP → v1 → v2)
- **MVP (0–4 months):**
  - Real-time monitoring, bill forecasting, manual load scheduling, and basic solar/battery optimization.
  - Integrations: EverBright inverter/battery, Nest/Google, Tesla Powerwall API (if available).
- **v1 (5–10 months):**
  - AI-based auto-scheduling, utility TOU plans, EV charger integration, and savings benchmark dashboard.
- **v2 (11–18 months):**
  - Utility demand response events, VPP participation, and predictive maintenance signals.

### Testing Approach
- **Alpha (internal):** 200 EverBright employee households; focus on data accuracy and automation trust.
- **Beta (customer cohort):** 2,000 households across 3 utilities to validate savings and behavioral adoption.
- **A/B tests:** Messaging (savings vs. sustainability), automation defaults, onboarding paths.

### Positioning Strategy
- **Value proposition:** “Cut your energy bill and maximize your solar ROI—automatically.”
- **Positioning:** Premium, trusted energy optimization layer for solar + battery owners.
- **Competitive differentiation:** Direct hardware integration + AI optimization + utility program enrollment.

### Pricing & Go-to-Market Plan
- **Pricing Model:**
  - **Freemium:** Monitoring + basic insights included for all EverBright customers.
  - **Premium ($12.99/month):** AI automation, TOU optimization, EV scheduling, and savings reports.
  - **Utility/VPP revenue share:** 20–30% of performance incentives.

- **GTM Strategy:**
  1. **Customer attach:** bundle premium trial with new EverBright installs for 3 months.
  2. **Partner distribution:** cross-promotion with EV charger OEMs and smart thermostat brands.
  3. **Utility partnerships:** enroll users into TOU and demand-response programs.
  4. **Lifecycle marketing:** targeted campaigns to high-usage customers and recent EV purchasers.

## 3) Performance Metrics, AI Integration, Long-Term Recommendations

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Savings Rate (%):** average % reduction in monthly bill vs. baseline.
2. **Automation Adoption (%):** % of users enabling AI scheduling within 30 days.
3. **Premium Conversion (%):** freemium → premium upgrade rate.
4. **Retention (90-day, 12-month):** measure product stickiness and value perception.
5. **Utility Program Participation (%):** enrollment in TOU or demand response.
6. **Net Revenue per User (NRPU):** subscription + utility revenue share.

### AI Integration
- **Forecasting:** Predict hourly household load and solar generation using weather + historical usage.
- **Optimization:** Use constraint-based scheduling to maximize savings while maintaining comfort (e.g., HVAC pre-cooling).  
- **Personalization:** Recommendations based on household routines and device usage.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identify battery inefficiencies and alert customers.

### Long-Term Recommendations & Roadmap (18–36 months)
- **Expand compatibility** with non-EverBright solar systems to grow TAM.
- **Launch VPP marketplace** with utilities to monetize load flexibility.
- **Introduce dynamic pricing contracts** where EverBright brokers best rates.
- **International expansion** in markets with high energy volatility (EU, Australia).
